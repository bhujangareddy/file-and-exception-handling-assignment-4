# file-and-exception-handling-assignment-4
These program demonstrates basic file handling operations in Python with proper error handling.

Task 1:

Program tries to read a file named sample.txt.
If the file exists, its content is displayed.
If the file is not found, a FileNotFoundError is handled and an error message is printed.

Task 2:

Program asks the user to enter some text and writes that text into a file called output.txt.
If the file already exists, its previous content is overwritten.

After that, the program again takes user input and appends the new text to the same file without deleting the existing content.

Finally, the program reads and displays the complete content of output.txt, showing both the written and appended data.

These program helps in understanding how to read, write, append files and how to handle exceptions safely in Python.
